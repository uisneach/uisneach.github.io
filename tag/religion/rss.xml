        <description>From ancient times until the fall of the Gaelic Order, a sacred fire at Uisneaċ was lit on Beltaine each year to initiate the Mórdáil Uisneaċ, the Great Assembly. As such Uisneaċ became spiritually the Umbilicas Hibernicae, the Navel of Ireland. It was a ceremonial gathering place for kings, possibly where the High King would symbolically marry the goddess Ériu in the banais ríghe ritual, or Marriage of the King. A fire was kept there perpetually into the Christian Age, kept alight by woman-druids in a similar fashion to Rome’s sacred flame tended by Vestal Virgins.</description>

&lt;p&gt;My reading of the Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm or 𝘕𝘪𝘨𝘰𝘯 𝘞𝘺𝘳𝘵𝘢 𝘎𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘰𝘳, which is one of the few Anglo-Saxon magical and medical texts that survives. It brings Woden and Christ into the same text, among many other esoteric passages. The Nine Herbs Charm was translated by Oswald Cockayne in 1866, seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/leechdomswortcun03cock/page/30/mode/2up&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and recently by Joseph Hopkins for &lt;a href=&#34;http://mimmisbrunnr.info&#34;&gt;mimmisbrunnr.info&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mimisbrunnr.info/nigon-wyrta-galdor&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a few contentious points that people disagree on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Herbs-and-Disease&#34;&gt;Herbs and Disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be interested in Woden, the glory-twigs, and the seven worlds, but this is foremost a medicinal text. The nine herbs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;𝘔𝘶𝘤𝘨𝘸𝘺𝘳𝘵 - Mugwort&lt;br&gt;
𝘞𝘦𝘨𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘥𝘦 “Waybread” - Plantain&lt;br&gt;
𝘚𝘵𝘶𝘯𝘦 - Lamb’s Cress&lt;br&gt;
𝘈𝘵𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘢ð𝘦 - Fumitory&lt;br&gt;
𝘔æ𝘨ðe - Chamomile&lt;br&gt;
𝘞𝘦𝘳𝘨𝘶𝘭𝘶 - Nettle&lt;br&gt;
Æ𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘭 - Crab Apple&lt;br&gt;
𝘍𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘦 - Chervil&lt;br&gt;
𝘍𝘪𝘯𝘶𝘭𝘦 - Fennel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text names the plant and sings the virtues of each, but the plant list is debated since the poem is unclear, some names may not be names. And in the prose section after the poem, the author changes the nine herbs: &lt;em&gt;stune&lt;/em&gt; becomes lambscress, &lt;em&gt;wergulu&lt;/em&gt; becomes nettle. But we know there are nine since in the prose he says there are 𝘯𝘺𝘨𝘰𝘯 𝘸𝘺𝘳𝘵𝘢, nine worts, which prevail against the nine venoms and nine “flying vile things”. The herbs are conceived of as nine types of soldier, warriors of the plant world, which war against poison, and which were placed in the world by the Lord (Christ or Woden). This warband of plants is led by the heavenly Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poison and disease are thought of as invisible serpents that writhe across the land, or swarms of flies in the air. They are called “loathful ones”, 𝘸𝘺𝘳𝘮.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;þu miht ƿiþ attre&lt;br&gt;
⁊ ƿið onflyge&lt;br&gt;
þu miht ƿiþ þa laþan&lt;br&gt;
ðe geond lond færð&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
For venom availest,&lt;br&gt;
For flying vile things;&lt;br&gt;
Mighty against loathed ones&lt;br&gt;
That through the land rove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines 9-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cockayne&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each herb has some inner strength that destroys or nullifies the venom of these malevolent spirits which wreak disease, if prepared the right way. Here it instructs the reciter to make a salve of the herbs, fennel, ashes, water, and egg, then to bathe the wound in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mugwort, waybroad which spreadeth open towards the east, lambscress, attorlothe, maythen, nettle, crab apple, chervil, fennel, and old soap; work the worts to a dust, mingle with the soap and with the verjuice of the apple; form a slop of water and of ashes, take fennel, boil it in the slop, and foment with egg mixture, when the man puts on the salve, either before or after. Sing the charm upon each of the worts; thrice before “he” works them up, and over the apple in like manner; and sing into the mans mouth and into both his ears the same magic song, and into the wound, before he applies the salve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph 46&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cockayne&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ancient herb-medicine. In Ireland at around this time (10th century), doctors had divided medicine into herb-medicine (pharmacology), knife-medicine (surgery), and song-medicine (prayer/chanting), which were the three methods available to ancient doctors: chemical intervention, surgical intervention, or lifestyle change. This entire charm is meant to be sung, hence why we call it the nine herbs 𝘨𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘰𝘳 or song. In fact, in the previous excerpt, we are specifically instructed to sing this charm to the herbs, and into the victim’s mouth and ears, and into the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease was seen as something which lingers high in the air, in cold, wet places, or within animals and plants which hate mankind, caused by malevolent spirits and which overtake people suddenly. A sickness must be weakened, then banished. Here, venom is something to be “blown away”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motan ealle weoda nu ƿyrtum aspringan&lt;br&gt;
sæs toslupan, eal sealt ƿæter&lt;br&gt;
ðonne ic þis attor of ðe geblaƿe&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
All weeds now may Give way to worts.&lt;br&gt;
Seas may dissolve, All salt water,&lt;br&gt;
when I this venom from thee blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph 45&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cockayne&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor is to blow the venom (or its evil spirit) out of the body, and then into something else, like the endless salty sea or a useless weed (𝘸𝘦𝘰𝘥𝘢) where it cannot do harm. It was the common view in most pre-modern societies that many things seen and unseen in the world were hostile to Man, and that an ally god would lead us in opposing these wild forces. For that reason he gave us the herbs, and taught us to use them. Chervil and Fennel, the author says, are mighty against pain, venom, a fiend’s hand, great guile, against small, bewitching wights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines 74-86&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cockayne&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the word ‘wihta’ is here translated by Cockayne as ‘farm-stock’, but truly just means ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wiht#Old_English&#34;&gt;thing, creature&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;

Nine wondrous twigs,&lt;br&gt;
He smote then the nadder&lt;br&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 59-66&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cockayne&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woden is named as leading the attack against the hostile 𝘸𝘺𝘳𝘮, taking nine glory-twigs 𝘸𝘶𝘭𝘥𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘴 and killing the serpent with them, diving it into nine pieces, and letting the crabapple dilute its venom. These glory-twigs are completely unknown. They could be pieces of wood carved with runes or other magical symbols, which are not unknown in the Germanic and Indo-European world. Tacitus &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0083%3Achapter%3D10&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that ancient Germans used boughs of a fruit tree, cut into pieces and carved with markings, which aid in divination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of the lots is simple. A little bough is lopped off a fruit-bearing tree, and cut into small pieces; these are distinguished by certain marks, and thrown carelessly and at random over a white garment. In public questions the priest of the particular state, in private the father of the family, invokes the gods, and, with his eyes towards heaven, takes up each piece three times, and finds in them a meaning according to the mark previously impressed on them. If they prove unfavourable, there is no further consultation that day about the matter; if they sanction it, the confirmation of augury is still required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Chapter 10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canterbury Charm is a runic marginal note calling on Thor to eliminate disease.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce&#34; aria-label=&#34;See Cotton MS Caligula A XV in the British Library, folio [123v](https://iiif.bl.uk/uv/#?manifest=https://bl.digirati.io/iiif/ark:/81055/vdc_100058106204.0x000001) and [124r](https://iiif.bl.uk/uv/#?manifest=https://bl.digirati.io/iiif/ark:/81055/vdc_100058106204.0x000001).
&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The fact that the Canterbury Charm had to be written in the margins of an unrelated text implies that the very act of being written down or carved was an essential part of the power of runes—writing itself as invocation. Perhaps Woden used runes and magic to banish the malignant spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Nine-Herbs-Charm/CanterburyCharm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Canterbury Charm and its Runes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Canterbury Charm in Manuscript and Transcribed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gyril wound-causer, go now! You are found. May Thor bless you, lord of ogres! Gyril wound-causer. Against blood-vessel pus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Canterbury Charm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Macleod and Mees&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the origins of the Irish ogham script is in carvings onto wood. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/auraicept00calduoft/page/272/mode/2up&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Auraicept na n-Eces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relates that the god Ogma created the alphabet by carving seven Bs into a strip of birch wood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moreover is the first thing that was written by Ogham, b was written, and to convey a warning to Lug son of Ethliu it was written respecting his wife lest she should be carried away from him into faeryland, to wit, seven b’s in one switch of birch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auraicept na n-Eces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Calder 1917&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the nine 𝘸𝘶𝘭𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘴 could be the nine herbs themselves, which would fit with the repetition of the number nine in the preceding lines. Ultimately it will be impossible to know for sure, as with many ancient mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Nine-Herbs-Charm/Tree.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Woden-⁊-Christ&#34;&gt;Woden ⁊ Christ&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;br&gt;
Then Wōden took VIIII glory-twigs,&lt;br&gt;

that she into VIIII flew,&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
ⵜFille and finule, a very mighty two,&lt;br&gt;
these worts the wise lord shaped,&lt;br&gt;

poor and prosperous, as remedy for all.&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
ⵜChrist stood over sickness of every kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lines 63-65 and Paragraph 45&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hopkins&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mention of Woden and Christ together seems contradictory. Is this a Christian writing down an invocation to a pagan god? Naturally the impassable pagan/Christian divide is mostly a modern invention of neopagans and secularized Christians. Medieval people were not often so discriminatory, calling upon a spirit or God as needed. If Christ seemingly failed them, they might in desperation call upon Woden or Thunor, then revert to Christ, or call upon a countless number of local land spirits, &lt;em&gt;genii locorum&lt;/em&gt;. The author seems to do just this, and even have fun with it, when he leaves ambiguity here. Which wise Lord (𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘨 𝘥𝘳𝘪𝘩𝘵𝘦𝘯) hangs in heaven, on a cross or on a tree? The same ambiguity is seen in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.csun.edu/~sk36711/WWW/258/DreamofRood.pdf&#34;&gt;Dream of the Rood&lt;/a&gt; which, for one example among many, calls the Cross a “Victory-beam” or “Victory-tree”. Both gods were meant to heal (or destroy evil spirits), and here we can see a melding of belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t a direct attestation of Anglo-Saxon paganism: it is simply a historical account of the ancient origin of the &lt;em&gt;wuldortanas&lt;/em&gt;. Christians like Alfred the Great also preserved Woden in the historical account of his own genealogy,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce&#34; aria-label=&#34;See *Historia Brittonum* [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1972/1972-h/1972-h.htm) for the genealogy of English kings c. 850 AD, or the *Anglian Collection of Royal Genealogies* [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44510666) c. 800 AD.
&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tracing his origin to a pre-Christian god but not worshipping that god (perhaps euhemerism was a popular belief).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Nine-Herbs-Charm/Woden.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woden&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Woden&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Nygon-Naedran&#34;&gt;Nygon Nædran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ic ana ƿat ea rinnende&lt;br&gt;
þær þa nygon nædran behealdað&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I alone know water running&lt;br&gt;
where the nine serpents beheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph 45&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hopkins&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the two most esoteric details, which I will struggle to treat somprehensively here. First, this verse that “I alone know a running stream, and the nine adders beware it”. The active verb here is 𝘣𝘦𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘢ð, “beholdeth”, but the meaning in Old English could be to hold, to behold, to do, to occupy. What is this running stream, and what are these nine serpents? The connection between serpents and running rivers is especially old, and could encompass a being like Niðhöggr, who in Völuspá and Gylfaginning is described in or near a river or the spring Hvergelmir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;En svá margir ormar eru í Hvergelmi með Níðhögg, at engi tunga má telja. Svá segir hér:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Askr Yggdrasils&lt;br&gt;

meira en menn viti;&lt;br&gt;
hjörtr bítr ofan,&lt;br&gt;
en á hliðu fúnar,&lt;br&gt;
skerðir Níðhöggr neðan.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Svá er enn sagt:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Ormar fleiri liggja&lt;br&gt;
und aski Yggdrasils&lt;br&gt;

Ófnir ok Sváfnir,&lt;br&gt;
hygg ek, at æ myni&lt;br&gt;
meiðs kvistum má.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Moreover, so many serpents are in Hvergelmir with Nídhöggr, that no tongue can tell them, as is here said:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Ash Yggdrasill | suffers anguish,&lt;br&gt;
More than men know of:&lt;br&gt;
The stag bites above; | on the side it rotteth,&lt;br&gt;
And Nídhöggr gnaws from below.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
And it is further said:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
More serpents lie | under Yggdrasill’s stock&lt;br&gt;
Than every unwise ape can think:&lt;br&gt;
Góinn and Móinn | (they’re Grafvitnir’s sons),&lt;br&gt;
Grábakr and Grafvölludr;&lt;br&gt;
Ófnir and Sváfnir | I think shall aye&lt;br&gt;
Tear the trunk’s twigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gylfaginning 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brodeur 1916&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sá hon þar vaða&lt;br&gt;
þunga strauma&lt;br&gt;

ok morðvarga&lt;br&gt;

Vituð ér enn - eða hvat?&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I saw there wading | through rivers wild&lt;br&gt;
Treacherous men | and murderers too,&lt;br&gt;
And workers of ill | with the wives of men;&lt;br&gt;
There Nithhogg sucked | the blood of the slain,&lt;br&gt;
And the wolf tore men; | would you know yet more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Völuspá 39&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Bellows 1923&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the verb 𝘣𝘦𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘢ð means that nine adders occupy the running river of Hell, and that this steaming river is where all disease originates. This would certainly be implied by the Völuspá and Gylfaginning passages. Likewise in Ireland, the famous Salmon of Wisdom which swim the Boyne and the Shannon are &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/toddlectureserie10royauoft/page/292/mode/2up&#34;&gt;local reflexes&lt;/a&gt; of an earlier serpent-in-river myth; one theory, which I believe wholeheartedly, is that since Ireland has no natural snakes the salmon are a substitute of one scaly aquatic creature for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In úair is abaig in cúas&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if 𝘣𝘦𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘥𝘢ð instead meant that the serpents “behold” or “fear” the river, this also agrees with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=29:chapter=12&#34;&gt;an account&lt;/a&gt; from Pliny about a Gaulish druidic rite wherein a druid steals a serpent’s egg, then as the creatures chase him he flees over a river, whereat the serpents halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;there is another kind of egg, held in high renown by the people of the Gallic provinces, but totally omitted by the Greek writers. In summer time, numberless snakes become artificially entwined together, and form rings around their bodies with the viscous slime which exudes from their mouths, and with the foam secreted by them: the name given to this substance is “anguinum.” The Druids tell us, that the serpents eject these eggs into the air by their hissing,4 and that a person must be ready to catch them in a cloak, so as not to let them touch the ground; they say also that he must instantly take to flight on horseback, as the serpents will be sure to pursue him, until some intervening river has placed a barrier between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pliny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Historia Naturalis 29.12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve theorized on this passage &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/ogmios/status/1377785701983477769&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and since then have found a few other cognate myths. The simple meaning of the serpent’s fear of rivers, if the serpents represent disease, is an injunction to bathing in fresh water. The more hidden meaning may be one of attaining enlightenment. Recall how Asgard is supposedly separated from our world by a number of running rivers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce&#34; aria-label=&#34;See *Gylfaginning* 15, [here](https://www.germanicmythology.com/ProseEdda/BRODEURPrologeandGylfaginning.html).
&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Recall also that Thor must wade through those rivers to get to the home of the gods, while the others choose to ride on a flaming rainbow bridge above him.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce&#34; aria-label=&#34;See *Gylfaginning* 15, [here](https://www.germanicmythology.com/ProseEdda/BRODEURPrologeandGylfaginning.html).
&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps this is Thor’s connection to humanity or his business killing devils which make him unclean, or perhaps he patrols the rivers for hidden dark spirits. Serpents are representative of bad spirits and sicknesses, which abhor fresh and clean running water, which can bite a sinner and either spread its own malignant essense into him, i.e. venom, or drink his blood thereby proving the sinner’s vile nature, i.e. a monster prefers blood like to itself. Thus passing over a river represents spiritual and corporeal purification, and the singer of this charm referencing a purifying river would indicate his own ritual purity, essential for healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be part of a larger Indo-European ritual cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Nine-Herbs-Charm/Salmon.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Seofon-Worulde&#34;&gt;Seofon Worulde&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ⵜFille and finule, felamihtigu twa&lt;br&gt;

poor and prosperous, as remedy for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second esoteric passage in the Nine Herbs Charm is this one, not only for the Lord hanging in Heaven, but for the strange mention of “seven worlds” (𝘝𝘐𝘐 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘶𝘭𝘥𝘦). Why not the typical nine worlds of the Eddas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever seven worlds appear, you can be sure of ancient astrology. The seven worlds can be seen in the sky: the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. But then how can the Lord send Chervil and Fennel to those worlds? Who lives there? These seven worlds must then be places inhabited by creatures and accessible. Planets are not ruled out, but that concept would be foreign to the Anglo-Saxon mind. More likely these are separate regions of a larger cosmos, yet connected, much as the nine worlds of Yggdrasil are. Or they could be more abstract planes of being. In the Rig Veda there is an indication of both seven and nine worlds, but seven seems to prevail.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce&#34; aria-label=&#34;See *The Cosmology of the Rigveda* by H. W. Wallis pg. 114, [here](https://archive.org/details/thecosmologyofth00walluoft/page/114/mode/2up), which concludes a cosmology of nine worlds by the time of Atharvaveda. For an argument for seven worlds, see *Vishnu in Rigveda* by Dmitri Semenov, [here](https://www.academia.edu/33047934/Vishnu_in_Rigveda), for certain passages which support the primacy of seven worlds in Rigveda.
&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is Earth and Heaven firstly, which are joined together “like two bowls turned toward each other”. Then there is the midspace between them, bringing us to 3 locations. Then we divide the Earth and Heaven each into three subsections, bringing us to 7 locations in the cosmos. Each location is then governed by a planet in the sky, which is a god or a god’s abode, or in some senses his vehicle, since the gods preside in starry Heaven, much like the many halls enumerated in the Edda which belong to one or another Norse god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these realms are not locations, rather they are states of being which can be traversed by the ritual practitioner.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; rel=&#34;footnote&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce&#34; aria-label=&#34;See *Vishnu in Rigveda* by Semenov, [here](https://www.academia.edu/33047934/Vishnu_in_Rigveda).&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; How many times in the Rig Veda does the singer desire to attain Heaven, lifted up by Agni to the home of the gods? Too many to count. He achieves this through his ritual alteration of consciousness. This reference in the Nine Herbs Charm may be a distant echo of such a cosmology, with the healer who sings this chant altering his state of consciousness to better interact with the malignant spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some also have taken the word 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘶𝘭𝘥𝘦 to mean “age of man” or “aion” instead or “world”, denoting time, not place. This would reduce the cosmology, but creates problems in parsing the logic of the verse then. Nevertheless, this has been the Nine Herbs Charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will finish this article for now. This impressive example of ancient medicine splendidly treats the nine herbs as beings, warriors even, in a spiritual battle against plague wights which stalk the lands unfit for habitation, revealing an ancient animist perspective in addition to its Christian and Germanic pagan ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A post on the appearance of milk in the Orphic Grave Tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milk is used as a symbol of immortality, which an Orphic initiate attains after death through specific ritual. Numerous grave tablets have this analogy. Firstly, the Orphic grave tablets are a series of Greek inscriptions on gold tablets deposited in tombs, most often in Magna Grecia (South Italy). The greatest is the Petelia Tablet, seen here, which was rolled up inside a gold cylinder on a chain. Tablet is c. 300 BC, while the case is c. 100 AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Milk-in-the-Orphic-Grave-Tablets/Petelia-Tablet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Petelia Tablet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see its Greek and next to it my translation. This is a rare tablet that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mention milk, but which is the most famous and goes to show the kind of content we’re considering. After death the initiate is to find the Lake of Mnemosyne (Memory) and drink from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;bilingual-table&#34; style=&#34;color:rgb(201, 202, 204);&#34;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; Ancient Greek &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt; English &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Εὑρήσσειϛ δ’ Ἀίδαο δόμων ἐπ ἀριστερὰ κρήνην, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; You will find to the left of Hades&#39; halls a spring, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; πὰρ δ’ αὐτῆι λευκὴν ἑστηκυῖαν κυπάρισσον· &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; And beside it a shining cypress standing. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ταύτηϛ τῆϛ κρήνηϛ μηδὲ σχεδὸν ἐμπελάσειαϛ. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; You will not come near to this spring. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; εὑρήσειϛ δ’ ἑτέραν, τῆϛ Μνημοσύνηϛ ἀπὸ λίμνηϛ &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; You will find another, from the Lake of Memory, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ψυχρὸν ὕδωρ προρέον· φύλακεϛ δ’ ἐπίπροσθεν ἔασιν. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; cold water flowing. Guards are stationed before it. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; εἰπεῖν· Γῆϛ παῖϛ εἰμι καὶ Οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντοϛ, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Say: &#34;I am a child of Earth and starry Heaven, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ γένοϛ οὐράνιον· τόδε δ’ ἴστε καὶ αὐτοί. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; and my race is of heaven. You yourselves know this. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; δίψηι δ’ εἰμὶ αὔη καὶ ἀπόλλυμαι. ἀλλὰ δότ’ αἶψα &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; I am parched to thirst and dying. Give me, quickly, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ψυχρὸν ὕδωρ προρέον τῆϛ Μνημοσύνηϛ ἀπὸ λίμνηϛ.’ &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; the cold water flowing from the Lake of Memory.&#34; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; καὐτοί σοι δώσουσι πιεῖν θείηϛ ἀπὸ κρήνηϛ, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; And they will give you to drink of the divine spring, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; καὶ τότ ἔπειτα τέλη σὺ μεθ’ ἡρώεσσιν ἀνάξειϛ. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; and then afterwards among the heroes you will have lordship. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Μνημοσύνης τόδε ... ... ... θανεῖσθαι ... &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; ... of Memory ... ... ... to die ...  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ... τόδε γραψ ... ... τογλωσειπα σκότοϛ ἀμφικαλύψαϛ. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; ... that is written ... ... darkness envelopes. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this the initiate will join the immortal heroes. Here is another one and my translation. This is a composition of the three Thurii Tablets A1-3 with almost identical texts; I have combined them in a way that seems most appropriate to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Milk-in-the-Orphic-Grave-Tablets/Thurii-Tablet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A Thurii Tablet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;bilingual-table&#34; style=&#34;color:rgb(201, 202, 204);&#34;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; Ancient Greek &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt; English &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Ἔρχομαι ἐκ καθαρῶν καθαρά, χθονίων βασίλεια, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; I come pure from the pure, Queen of the Underworld, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Εὖκλε καὶ Εὐβουλεῦ τε καὶ θεοὶ ευδαίμονες ἄλλοι· &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Eukles, Euboleus, gods and other good spirits, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼν ὑμῶν γένος εὔχομαι ὄλβιον εἶναι &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; for indeed of your blessed race I claim to be. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ποινὰν δ’ ἀνταπέτεισ’ αντ ἔργων οὔτι δικαίων. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; You have repaid unrighteous deeds with punishments. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; εἴτε με Μοῖρα ἐδάμασσε καὶ αθανατοι θεοι αλλοι &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; either Fate subdued me, or the other deathless gods, or the Thunderer throwing his thunderbolt. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; βροντε τ’ ἀστεροπε τε και αιθαλοεντι κεραυνῶ. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; I flew out of the bitter grief-stricken circle, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Κύκλου δ’ εξεπταν βαρυπενθοες αργαλεοιο &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; to the desired crown I came with swift feet, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ’Ιμερτόν δ’ επεβαν στεφανον ποσι καρπαλιμοισι &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; I went down under the bosom of the Lady, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Δεσποινας δ’ ύπο κολπον εδυν χθονιας βασιλειασ. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Queen of the Underworld. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Νυν δ’ ικετης αγνην ηκω παρα Φερσεφονειαν &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Now a supplicant I have come beside pure Persephone &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ’Ως με προφρων πεμψη εδρας ες τας μακαριστας εὐαγέων &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; so that, in kindness, she will send me to the seats of the most blessed pious ones. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ’Ολβιε και μακαριστε, θεος δέση άντι &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Happy and most blessed, a god you shall be instead of a mortal. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; βροτοιο εριφοσ ες γαλ’ επετον. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; A kid goat flying into milk. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Notice the last line, “a kid (goat) flying/rushing into milk,” immediately after becoming a Θεός. An allegory for apotheosis, in which the young goat is submerged in that which he craves most, in the same way the initiate entering the halls of the heroes is plunged into bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my translation of a third tablet from Thurii, Italy, known as A4. We once again see the formulation of a kid goat falling or rushing into milk immediately after the initiate has become a god, Θεός.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;bilingual-table&#34; style=&#34;color:rgb(201, 202, 204);&#34;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; Ancient Greek &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt; English &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Ἀλλ’ ὁπόταν ψυχὴ προλίπηι φάος ἀελίοιο, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Whenever the soul might leave behind the light of the Sun, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; δεξιὸν εννοιας δει τινα πεφυλαγμένον εὖ μάλα πάντα· &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; travel to the right, being well guarded in every way. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; χαῖρε παθὼν τὸ πάθημα τὸδ’ οὔπω πρόσθε ἐπεπόνθεις· &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Hail, you who has experienced this experience, which you had not experienced before. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; θεὸς ει ελεεινού έξ άνθρόπου. ἔριφος ἐς γάλα ἔπετες. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; A god has been gained from a man. A young goat falling into milk. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; χαῖρε χαῖρε· δεξιὰν ὁδοιπορών &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Hail, hail. Journey to the right through &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; λειμῶνάς τε ἱεροὺς κατ’ ἄλσεα Φερσεφονείας. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; the holy meadows and groves of Persephone. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a fourth from Pelinna, Thessaly, Greece. Here you see it most strongly, because it’s repeated three times (almost as if reflecting the thrice-blessed τρισολβιε appellation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;bilingual-table&#34; style=&#34;color:rgb(201, 202, 204);&#34;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; Ancient Greek &lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt; English &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; νῦν ἔθανες καὶ νῦν ἐγένου, τρισόλβιε, ἄματι τῶιδε. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Now you have died and you have been born, thrice-blessed, on this very day. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; εἰπεῖν Φερσεφόναι σ’ ὅτι Βάκχιος αὐτὸς ἔλυσε. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Tell Persephone that Bacchus himself freed you. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; ταιῦρος εἰς γάλα ἔθορες. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; A bull into milk, you leapt. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; αἶψα εἰς γάλα ἔθορες. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Quickly into milk, you sprang. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; κριὸς εἰς γάλα ἔπεσες. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; A ram into milk, you fell. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; οἶνον ἔχεις εὐδαίμονα τιμὴν &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; You have wine as a fortunate honor &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; καὶ σὺ μὲν εἶς ὑπὸ γῆν τελέσας ἅπερ ὄλβιοι ἄλλοι &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; and you, indeed, will go under the earth, having been consecrated &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; as the other blessed ones. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why milk? The simplest anthropological reading is that milk is something a kid (goat) craves, so falling into (an ocean of) milk represents the good afterlife, one where all the things which we sought in the  material world are supplied in abundance. This imagery would make sense to a pastoral people. This summing up all of Orphic initiation into a single symbolic phrase is called a &lt;em&gt;synthema&lt;/em&gt;, and would serve to remind the initiate that all his trainings are what earn him immortality or knowledge of his true self. But the verb “rushing or leaping” (&lt;em&gt;εθορες&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;επεσες&lt;/em&gt;) could also imply a ritualistic action or dance performed before death. We see this in other Greek cults, as when Cretan youths imitated the dance of the &lt;em&gt;Kouretes&lt;/em&gt;, or when “rushing” Maenads celebrate the coming of Dionysus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Milk-in-the-Orphic-Grave-Tablets/Taurus-Leap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cretan Athletes Leaping Over a Bull&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milk in Greece, as in all Aryan societies, was connected intimately with the stars and therefore Heaven &amp;amp; the gods. The word for milk, &lt;em&gt;γάλα&lt;/em&gt; “gala”, seemed to converge with celestial words, like the Milky Way galaxy, known as &lt;em&gt;γάλακτος&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;κύκλος&lt;/em&gt; “milky wheel”, &lt;em&gt;γαλαχιος&lt;/em&gt; “galaxios”, or even &lt;em&gt;το γάλα&lt;/em&gt; “the milk”. The Milky Way was the Road of Souls to the afterlife, possibly what Pindar called “Zeus’s Way” in Olympian 2. Souls would also descend from the abode of the blessed gods to incarnate, thus explaining why babies needed to drink specifically milk from their mothers. There were many beliefs that souls became stars once in Heaven, as in this Arkesine inscription “Mother, do not weep for me. What is the use? You ought rather to reverence me, for I have become an evening star, among the gods.” So then our milk seems to be a stand-in for Heaven, or that the Heavens were observably full of milk. And when the tablets say &lt;em&gt;εις γάλα εθορες&lt;/em&gt;, it may not mean “you rushed into milk”, but “you rushed into the galaxy (i.e. Heaven &amp;amp; the gods)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milk was symbolic of the end of life for blessed heroes and initiates, and of the beginning of life for newborn babies. Thus it probably represented a cycle of rebirth, or at least incarnation. The wicked are deprived of milk in Hades or Tartaros. Is this idea Indo-European? We see an identical conflation in Ireland, where the Irish name of the Milky Way is the &lt;em&gt;Bealach ná Bó Finne&lt;/em&gt; or “Way of the White Cow”; Vedic Aryans called it, among other names, &lt;em&gt;devapatha&lt;/em&gt; or “god path”. In each, the souls of dead heroes walk it. The primordial milk-giving cow in &lt;em&gt;Gylfaginning&lt;/em&gt; supports the life of Ymir, and perhaps the Norse thought it was her milk which spilled across Heaven to form the Milky Way. In Irish we seem to have a heavenly cow as well in the &lt;em&gt;Bó Firinne&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between milk and the white galaxy overhead is strong, as is the conception of that region of the sky being the home of the gods. These are the double-meanings which Greek Orphic initiates understood when going through their trainings. For the initiate, his recollection of his “true self” would earn him entry into the abode of the gods and heroes, and so would literally enter the milk above, and fall into a milk which is desirable and pleasant. Since his enlightened state is due to his initiation, we could even say that his initiation on Earth is an early development of his enlightened state in Heaven, and so his initiation is the milk he seeks. And the initiate would be the young goat, inexperienced and even clumsy, who needs spiritual sustenance (i.e. Orphic wisdom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the milk formulae in these tablets appear to be synthemata meant to remind the initiate of the culmination of his Orphic training, and simultaneously of the immense pleasures of Heaven and the gods after death, just as we take pleasure from drinking fresh milk on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my broad, surface level theory, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fin.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; class=&#34;aplayer-secondary-style-marker&#34; href=&#34;/assets/css/APlayer.min.css&#34;&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;/assets/js/APlayer.min.js&#34; class=&#34;aplayer-secondary-script-marker&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Menhir.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s remember the concept of Aions. An Aion is very similar to a Yuga, but derived from Hellennic and Indo-European astrology and the procession of the equinox rather than a division of the eternal cycle into four descending sections. The movement of the Earth’s axis over time causes the constellations to drift slowly with respect to the Earth, specifically the spring horizon. When Hipparchus discovered this c. 150 BC, the spring equinox sun sat in front of Aries; by 1000 AD, it sat well in front of Pisces. And so the very stars themselves change precedence over us. Choosing the spring equinox was somewhat arbitrary, but choose any astronomical point and the stars behind it will drift. Since the stars hold gentle influence over our lives, our minds, and our stories, the changing of the stars also changes the nature of the world itself. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/ogmios/status/1392592990393229317&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; for a breakdown of ancient star-wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point cannot be overstated: different aions have different rulers, just as the stars do. One aion will not be the same as any other. What is Right and Good in one, will be Boring, Tired, Ineffective in another. We can even say that they have different rules. Another point about the astronomy of this: many people divide the sky into twelve &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; sections, instead of dividing then based on where the constellations end. Any Astrology based on math rather than naked-eye observations is inferior, speaking anthropologically. Research Tropical vs Sidereal systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Stars.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/AionChart.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with one we all know. When the stars of Aries were presiding, the world was led by the Aries archetype. This aion stretched from roughly 2000 BC to 0 AD. During this time the Ram, not the Bull or the Fishes, was the primary world archetype. The Ram meant that the actions of all the people of the world were characterized by pushing, creating boundaries, and challenging. Force itself was king. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/ogmios/status/1402068975740243969&#34;&gt;hidden meaning of the Celtic Ram&lt;/a&gt;. And what major events did the world see during the reign of the Ram? The first division of the world into empires. And the two crowning achievements of the Age, Alexander’s Empire and Rome’s Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Babylon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Babylonian Empire&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Alexander.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alexander&#39;s Empire&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Rome.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Roman Empire&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, it paid to be expansionist and violent. The primary archetype of that age was Achilles, who noticeably gained no land, but rather paved the way for other diplomats to take the land he conquered. If Achilles was born in 1500AD, his same actions would never work. Because the conditions of society in 1500 AD or 3500 BC were inappropriate for Achilles’ warlike nature. The time was not proper for a pure berserker like him. The Ram was the driving force behind the expansion of centralized political states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare this aion to the Aion of Taurus. The Bull is not forceful like the Ram, but he symbolizes wealth and stable sovereignty. A person with Sun in Taurus prefers to enjoy his winnings and to conquer power centers rather than enforce borders. What could be a major event of the Taurean Age? The Bronze Age Expansions of course, among the proto-Indo-Europeans, the proto-Semites, the Bantus at the very end, etc. Yet, these peoples never established political control as their descendants did in the Arian Age. The lack of central authority allowed the growth on thousands of local city states, as we see most iconically in Sumer and Babylon, but also in, for example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://balkhandshambhala.blogspot.com/2012/10/bactria-land-of-thousand-cities.html&#34;&gt;Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex&lt;/a&gt;, the “land of a thousand cities.” Think of Conan the Barbarian as the archetypal Taurean warrior: traversing vast distances to strike down an evil central figure and to take rule of the city. Think of Gilgamesh, who was King of Ur, or Agamemnon, who, in the Arian Age myth, was usurped by the Arian Hero. The contrast throughout the Iliad between Agamemnon and Achilles is the dual energies of the Taurean warrior and the Arian warrior. The one wants to revel in his riches at the expense of honor, and wants the city. The other seeks honor and battle death, not material wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/IE-Expansion.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Indo-European Expansion Map&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Agamemnon.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, there is a Taruean aesthetic in the contruction of forts and religious temples during the Taurean Aion. &lt;a href=&#34;https://rgdn.info/en/nyugreyndzh_-_nasledie_druidov&#34;&gt;Newgrange&lt;/a&gt;, built by the Dagda, who is sometimes literally a bull; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/white-temple-and-great-ziggurat-mesopotamian-city-uruk-006835&#34;&gt;White Temple of Uruk&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://pk-photography.blogspot.com/2011/06/mohenjo-daro.html&#34;&gt;Mohenjo Daro&lt;/a&gt;; singular, glorious temples and cities. Let’s compare these to art and artifacts of the Arian Age: pottery, below from 1300 BC, horses and war chariots; the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thearchaeologist.org/blog/treasury-of-atreus-the-monumental-mycenaean-tomb&#34;&gt;Treasury of Atreus&lt;/a&gt;, Mycenae; most steppe and early European &lt;a href=&#34;https://minervamagazine.com/treasures-of-the-scythian-kings.html&#34;&gt;burial mounds&lt;/a&gt; were formed in this aion, richly adorned and scattered across the lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Pottery.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement from Taurus to Aries brought us the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mysterium.com/eighthgate.html&#34;&gt;Mithraic Tauroctony&lt;/a&gt; (notice: the Zodiac above Mithras). The transition caused Moses to reject the Golden Cow (notice: gold, wealth, Taurean symbols) in favor of the forceful God of Fire. A Mosaic Tauroctony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/MosesSerpent.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;http://amortalperspectiveofeternity.blogspot.com/2012/03/moses-and-brass-serpent.html&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Moses and the Brass Serpent by Judith Mehr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back further. Before Taurus the world was in Gemini, approx. 6,000 - 4,000 BC. We have little to no direct mythical evidence of the Geminian Age, except for echoes in myths written in later Ages, but archaeology has given us a solid idea of what the world was like then. Most of Europe was settled by Anatolian Farmers within this Aion. This was when Mercury/Lugh/Wotan taught our ancestors farming, craft skills, and writing. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prehistory.it/ftp/inventory/danube_script/danube_script_01.htm&#34;&gt;Vinča Script&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s earliest letters, dates from about 5000 BC. Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury, and the Twins of Gemini reflect this. The Twins are an echo of a myth which was surely the dominant world-archetype in the Geminian Aion. They are Castor and Pollux to the Greeks. Pollux was the soul of Castor, both sons of Zeus and of Tyndareus of Sparta (or in other versions, one was the son of immortal Zeus and the other of mortal Tyndareus). In Babylon, the Twins are Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra (Lugh?), which mean “One who has arisen from the Underworld” (Otherworld?) and “Mighty King”. That is, one is “dead” or a spirit, and one is a King or at least royalty. Both are associated with a god of sickness and health. We can therefore expect that the Geminian Aion is that era in which Man first discovered his soul as separate from his own being, or his Self as separate from his Ego. One dies, one never dies. One can be King, one is only a spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean that Man’s soul first became separate from himself? Man first became self-aware at this time. He started on the path of becoming an individual rather than an extension of the tribe. It was the birth of consciousness, hence why the Bible dates Genesis to this time. Before that time, in the Cancerian Aion specifically, Man was merely a finger of the tribal hand, an appendage of the racial arm. By developing his conscious mind, as opposed to his collective, unconscious mind, he began writing, planning for agriculture, trading, and thinking. And the trade of ideas between peoples and within the mind was mirrored by trading routes between the first cities. Communication as well. The cities of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vision.org/de/node/161&#34;&gt;Eridu&lt;/a&gt;, Aleppo, &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?id=TSLeX0GRNqwC&amp;amp;q=121#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=7%2C000%20years%20of%20a%20settled%20community&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Argos&lt;/a&gt; (which introduced standard weights to Greece), and Athens were first inhabited under the stars of Gemini. The myth of the birth of the Dioscuri is arguably a myth of the transition from Gemini to Taurus, as the Taurean God Zeus eventually sent the Twins to live in the stars. One of Athens’ most ancient temples is dedicated to the Dioscuri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Eridu.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eridu&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cancerian Aion, c. 8,000 - 6,000 BC, the time of the Great Mother, in which Man first began to coagulate into permanent villages. The Mother archetype which ruled this Aion was what inspired man to form homes and establish family life. As we go back further, we have fewer and fewer myths, as well as far less material evidence. I can’t point to a single anti-Mother myth which signals the end of Cancer and the beginning of Gemini, but the archetype is certainly there. Gaia’s sons, Rhea’s sons, etc. The most appropriate, perhaps, is Leto, who birthed the divine siblings Artemis and Apollo. Quite literally a mythic mother figure giving way to her two divine children. The state of the world in the Cancerian Aion was the first major step away from nomadic hunting and gathering. Many peoples supplemented their game with crops, and build solid houses for the first time. (Structures are dated prior this age, but they increased their range here). I want to emphasize: we have an aversion to “The Feminine” now which is unfounded. There is a time and a place for feminine energy, just like all things, and in the Cancerian Aion “feminine” actions would make you powerful. Actions like building a house and defending it. The question is whether we need feminine energy today, or masculine. And the answer is both and neither, we apply them selectively at one time or another. In other words, it’s up to you, and the spirit of the age will guide you. The Aion of Cancer was likely also the first time Man consciously discovered the workings of Woman’s pregnancy, that it wasn’t some supernatural act but that it had a cause and effect. Many other sexual lessons likely emerged in these two thousand years, for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And earliest, the Aion of Leo, from c. 10,000 BC to 8,000 BC when the Sun rose into the Lion constellation on the spring equinox. Directly succeeding the last glacial maximum, the Aion of Leo was a time of bold leaders and actors, unconcerned with personal loss or homes. A majority of the world was still hunter-gatherers: this was the mythical Golden Age. Man was yet undivided from the tribe, and acted as an extension of the group. For this reason, with the world warming again, each band of men took leaders to roam the world and win what prizes could be won. The lion brings with it the waters of glacial ice melt, which show that through daring and action the world can be enriched. Leo, ruled by the Sun, showed Man to strive for something greater than mere survival. We cannot say much more about this time, because even in archeology the lights are dim. Göbekli Tepe was built in Turkey, and Star Carr was inhabited in Yorkshire. There is a popular perception that people then were less inteligent or capable only of milling about the village’s mud houses, but directional social organization was a new phenomenon. Without being constrained by the frozen environment, our ancestors were allowed to take bold actions in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Leo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Aion of Leo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In roughly 0 AD we passed from Aries into Pisces, this is the transition people still argue over. Our world shifted from a priority of force (which was good in its time) to one of mercy and grace (which is coming to an end soon). This isn’t to say that force became unnecessary, remember that we’re speaking of the permutations of the soul here, and its fascinations. Jesus showed our ancestors their latent fascination with goodness, purity, and sanctity over dominance. The Two Fishes, as opposed to the Ram, signified the divergence of Good and Evil. The serpent as a symbol was and is hated by Piscean Man, but welcomed as a scion of wisdom by Arian and Taurean Man. Is it any coincidence that the East with Buddhism and the West with Christianity converted to new religions centered on very similar figures, with very similar practices when compared to the Arian paganisms they replaced? The nature of the world was changing. Plenty of symbolism points to the shift from an Aries Aion to a Pisces Aion. Jesus appears as a slain lamb (Ram), for example, one of his christograms is a fish, his apostles are “fishers of men”, and his dark counterpart in the figure of Satan, who is the second fish of Pisces. And this should make sense. The Romans had mastered life in the Arian Age, become the best warriors and empire builders. If the world hadn’t changed, human life would have stultified under the immortal and bloated Roman Empire. God struck down the serpent which was holding back the waters of change, and the world shifted again. This is his plan for mankind, and Europa specifically, prewritten in the stars and he dislikes when people defy his plan, hence why the reactionary movement to return to an agrarian world which ended centuries ago will fail. The pseudo-reactionary movement to build a new world on top of the wisdom of the old world will succeed. No one can reverse turning of the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are moving into into Aquarian Aion, from roughly 2000 AD to 4000 AD. People debate on when it really begins, but I believe it began in the 60s, and the transition period will last until the 2140s. We have both Piscean and Aquarian energy in the world right now. The Age of Aquarius will be characterized by a longing for wisdom, likely caused by a forgetfulness of the past and tradition. Aquarius is the countersign of Leo, and the halfway point around the Great Year of 26,000 years. So I theorize that the next 6 aions will be spent consciously rediscovering all the truths and esoteric sciences which were lost in the past 12,000 years. We will once again understand the body, the mind, and the spirit, and be able to navigate our world in strength and virtue. Aquarius as the countersign of Leo also indicates that everything lacking in the Aion of Leo will occur in overabundance in the Aion of Aquarius. Every sign has their countersign, and also occurs in a fractal nature. Every year the sun travels through these signs; every month, the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this astrological view allows us to understand the triumph of Christianity over paganism. Both are appropriate only for their times. The resurgence of pagan, or “non-Christian” ideas, in our time is the dawning of the Aquarian quest for wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/Religion-Across-the-Aions/Aquarius.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Aquarian Aion Art&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

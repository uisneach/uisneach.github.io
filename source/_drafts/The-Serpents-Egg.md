Pliny the Elder writes in Historia Naturalis about a strange druid artefact, called the Serpent’s Egg. He first tells us how it was made: a druid explained to Pliny that, during the summer and under a certain moon, a numberless mass of snakes will “become artificially entwined and “form rings around their body with the viscous slime which exudes from their mouths, and with the foam secreted by them.” He calls this substance (the slime and foam) “anguinum” [Latin for “snake’s egg”]. Then, “the serpents eject these eggs into the air by their hissing” and before it hits the ground, a man must catch it in his cloak. Then the man must take to flight on horseback, as the snakes will give chase to him. He is safe once he crosses a river, which the snakes cannot cross.

Pliny says that a genuine egg will float against the current of a river, even though the egg is “set in gold”. He then states that he doesn’t fully believe the druid who told him this, since druids are “dextrous and cunning in casting a veil about their frauds” (i.e. druids are secretive of their knowledge and are smart enough to lie).

Pliny says that he saw one of these eggs, presumably handed to him by the druid. It is “round, and about as large as an apple of moderate size; the shell of it was formed of a cartilaginous substance, and it was surrounded with numerous cupules [cup-shaped anatomical structure] resembling the arms of a polypus.” The druids, he says, highly value this egg, since possessing it ensures success in lawsuits, glowing reputation, and general success. He tells that Emperor Tiberius killed a man because he held a Serpent’s Egg during a trial, which was outlawed.

“It is this entwining of serpents... and the fruitful results of this unison, that seem to me to have given rise to the usage among foreign nations, of surrounding the caduceus with representations of serpents”. Here Pliny attributes the ancient Caduceus to this druid phenomenon.

Of the ancient sources which claim to have seen this stone, but no one claims to have witnessed its creation.

What snake was it, then, that the druids saw coalescing into a ball? Of the continental snakes in Europe, many gather in balls to keep warm in the winter, not in the summer as Pliny states. This could be another trick of the druid to safeguard his secrets.

Snakes also ball up to mate, which could make this phenomenon during the mating season. Then the slime and foam secretions would be involved in the mating process. The what is the egg? Of the egg-laying snakes of Europe, a notable one is the python. When a Python lays an egg, it coils around it and shivers to raise its body temperature, and keep the egg warm. A ball of writhing snakes may well have been simply warming their eggs, which a druid might steal.

The Python mythologically was said to guard the omphalos at Delphi in a similar manner. This could be a strong link between the traditions of the druids and the Delphic cult that revered the omphalos stone.

Later, Apollo developed as enemy of the Python and slew it.

The omphalos is a rock said to be thrown down by Zeus to mark the center of the world, after he measured it. It is also said that the omphalos was the stone used by Rhea to trick Kronos all those years ago. And if Zeus threw it down, does that make this stone a meteorite?

This and the above are carvings of the actual omphalos, which is lost, showing the stone underneath covered in knotted ropes of cloth. This was revered at Delphi. Knowing of the snake cult at Delphi, and Python guarding the stone as if it were his egg, we can ask whether the Pliny's Serpent Egg was really a ball of hardened slime, or the snakes’ real egg. If they are guarding their eggs, then it makes perfect sense to chase after the druid.

But if this egg is a recreation of the omphalos guarded by Python, then the power of the omphalos would also be within the Serpent Egg, by virtue of association. Python’s Great Egg lies at the center of Gaia, and the smaller serpent egg is a mere talisman with derivative power.

Since Pliny gives the origin of the Caduceus to be this phenomenon, we should inspect that too. The Caduceus is the staff of Hermes, around which two snakes curl. As we all know, this symbol is a representation of the chakra energies present in Kundalini.

The oldest appearance of this symbol is traced to Mesopotamia around 3000-4000 BC (the dawn of Sumer), from the serpent god Ningishzida (lit. “lord of the good tree”). We could assume, then, that the twisted serpents came into Greece through Mesopotamia, however I doubt the twisted snake myth could have made it to Scotland, where we find similar stones called “gloin nan druidh” (Druid Stones). A Gloin nan Druidh is any small stone, usually flint, with a natural hole through it. In English it is usually called a hagstone.

A similar tradition of stones with holes appear all over Europe (@FortressOfLugh just did a video on larger Odin Stones). A stone with a natural hole has had much magical significance well into modern times. In Wales they say that the hole in the adder stone (“glain y naidr”) is the result of an adder bite. These stones could be the objects which the snakes swarm and then eject. But Britain has no egg-laying snakes, so this Serpent’s Egg tradition could not have originated from there, but had to be imported as part of a druidic, proto-Celtic tradition.

This same tradition could have inspired the Python cult at Delphi, also of a snake protecting a stone, since the Celts did inhabit Thrace for a while.

Then, we have: The Python is guarding the omphalos, sent by Zeus to the center of the world at Delphi. Apollo slays the Python and establishes his temple at Delphi, thus claiming the omphalos as his own, and the power of Zeus with it.

Likewise, the Druid must steal the omphalos (Serpent’s Egg) from within the mass of snakes and get away with it, thus claiming a smaller portion of the power of Zeus that lies in the Delphic omphalos and reenacting the Python myth. Continuously stealing the power of Gaia for Zeus.

The Caduceus, then, originating in Sumer, would be an earlier form of this twisted-snake cult, which was brought down to Sumer by the blue-eyed aristocracy that brought chariot wheels, agriculture, and kingship to the land.

Herodotus relates that the Scythians had once raided “all of Asia”, and we know the Aryans migrated into India, so we can also suspect the rulers of Sumer were members of the Arya people and took part in the twisted-snake tradition.

Now, for the symbolism. When I heard that there were tales of snakes twisting themselves, and the result was an egg with the power of the gods, I knew. We all knew. Two serpents twisting themselves around the magic egg? Pineal gland, kundalini, chakras and Hermes.

The pinecone, being the ancient representation of the pineal gland, shares the same shape as an egg and omphalos.

It’s entirely possible that the druids knew the old Ayran secrets of kundalini energy transmutation, and kept this practice a secret to the uninitiated.

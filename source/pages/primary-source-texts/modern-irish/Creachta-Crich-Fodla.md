Créaċta Críċ Fódla[^0]
Is atuirseaċ gear liom créaċta críċ Fódla[^1]
Fá sgamall[^2] go daor ‘sa gaolta clí-ḃreóiġte;
Na cranna baḋ ṫréine[^3] ag déanaṁ dín dóiḃ sin
Do gearraḋ a ngéaga[^4] ‘r a bpréaṁa crín-feoiġte.

Cé fada ḋuit, 'Éire,[^5] ṁaorḋa, ṁín-nósṁar,
Ad’ ḃanaltrain tséiṁ le féile is fíor-eólus,
Beir feasda ad’ ṁéirdrig fé gaċ críon-ċóisir,
‘S gaċ ladrann coṁaiṫeaċ[^6] b’éis do ċlí ḋeóltaḋ.

Is mar ḃarra air mo ṁéala, feuċ gur díol deóra,
Go ngaḃann gaċ récs don réim sin Roinn Eoruip[^7]
A ḃairrḟionn tais féin go saoġalta síṫeóilte,
Aċt Banba a bpéin gan céile is í posta!

Do Ċailleamar préim-ṡlioċt Néill is síol Eogain,
Is na fearaċoin[^8] tréana, laoċra ríoġaċt Bóirṁe,
Den Ċaraṫ-ḟuil[^9] ḟéil, mo léan, ní’l puinn béo aguinn!
Ná ṁaiṫe na nGaeḋeal do b'éaċtaċ gníoṁ coṁraic.[^10]

Is dearḃ gurab é gaċ éigion íogcóra,[^11]
Ganguid is éiṫeaċ, claon is díoṫ-ċóṁall,
Gan ceangal le ċéile, aċt raobaḋ rínn-sgórnaċ,
Do ṫarraing ar Éirinn[^12] fraoċ an Ríoġ ċoṁaċtaig.

Dó ċailleamar Éire is méad ár mío-ċoṁṫrom,
Is treasgairt na laoċ mear, treun, nár ṁí-ṫreóraċ,
Air Arad-Ṁac[^13] Dé ‘s air ṫreun na Tríonóide
Go mairfiḋ bá n-éir an mead so ḋíoḃ beó aguinn.

Ċailleadar Gaoḋail a dtréiṫe caoin córaċ,
Carṫanaċt, féile, beusa, is bínn-ċeólta;
Alla-tuirc[^14] claon do ṫraoċ sinn faoi ṁór-smaċt;
Agallaim Aon-Ṁac Dé air Gaoiḋil[^15] d’fóirṫin.

The Wounds of Fodla
Woeful and bitter to me are the wounds of the land of Fodla,
Who is sorely under a cloud whilst her Kinsfolk are heartsick;
The trees that were strongest in affordine them shelter
Have their branches lopped off and their roots withering in decay.

Long though thou hast been, O majestic, gentle-mannered Erin,
A fair nursing-mother with hospitality and true knowledge;
Henceforth shalt thou be an unwilling handmaid to every withered band,
While every foreign boor shall have sucked thy breasts.

And to crown my sorrow, behold it is a fit subject for tears,
That every King of the dynasties who divide Europe amongst them
Possesses his own fair, gentle spouse in prosperity and peace,
While Banba is in pain without a consort, wedded though she be.

We have lost the root-stock of Niall and the seed of Eoghan,
And the bold champions, the warriors of the kingdom of Boruṁa;
Of the hospitable race of Carthach, woe is me! we have not many alive,
Nor of the chieftains of the Gael who were of renowned feats in battle.

In sooth it is every violence of injustice on our part,
Deceit and falsehood and treachery and dishonesty,
Our want of union, and, instead, the tearing of each other’s throats,
That have drawn down on Erin keenly the rage of the Mighty King.

Since we have lost Erin, and because of the extent of our misfortunes,
And because of the overthrow of the nimble, strong warriors, who were not wanting in vigour,
We entreat the noble Son of God and the Might of the Trinity,
That those of them who are alive with us may thrive after them.

The Gaels have lost their gentle, comely qualities;
Charity, hospitality, manners, and sweet music;
Wicked, alien boars it was that forced us under great oppression;
I beseech the Only Son of God to grant relief to the Gaels.

[^0]: Of this poem there are several partial copies. There is a copy containing all the stanzas given here in vol. 69 of the Renehan MSS. in Maynooth College. The piece, however, seems naturally to end with the sixth stanza. 23.C.8, p.99, gives as heading: "An fear céadna cct. iar mbrise na gcoinġoill do Ġallaiḃ do ro Ġealladar i Luimneach 1692." In 23.D.8. styled "Marna na hĖireann."
[^1]: Some MSS. read *Is atuirseaċ géar*. *Críċ Fódla* is taken as one word, hence *críċ* is not put in gen. The dat. (*críċ*) is often used instead of the nom. (*críoċ*) in nouns belonging to the second decl.
[^2]: *sgamail, D.8.
[^3]: *ba ṫréan*, B.38. *Na cranna*, metaphorical for "great families."
[^4]: *A ngéag. Most MSS. have the pl. *géaga*, which gives an extra syllable. Some have *géaḋa*, a softened form of *géaga*. *Crín Feóiġte* in some MSS.
[^5]: *'Éire*, for *a Éire*, the *a* being absorbed by the initial vowel.
[^6]: *Caéṫaċ* for *coiṁiġṫeaċ*, generally pron. *caoiṫeaċ*.
[^7]: *Roinn Eóroip*, the Continent of Europe; it is not declined. *Deréim ċirt*, of the true sovereignty. *Gaċ récs*, all the kings.
[^8]: *Fearaċoin*, pl. of *fearaċú*, i.e., *fearċú*.
[^9]: *Carraṫ-ḟuil*. Some MSS. have *caruid-ḟuil*. The word *cárrṫaċ* is sometimes trisyllabic, *carraṫaċ*; cf. *feárr*, *fearra*.
[^10]: Some MSS. and First Edition read *Is fada sinn tréiṫ fá léir-scrios ḃuiḋin Leópaid*: "And long have we been helpless under the devastation of Leopold’s band."
[^11]: *Íogcóraċ*, gen. of *íogcóir* or *éagcóir*, "wrong, injustice."
[^12]: *Ar Éirinn*. Some MSS. give *go faoḃraċ*.
[^13]: *Mí-ċóṁṫrom*, "injustice, inequality of treatment."
[^14]: *Arrad-Ṁac*, i.e., *Ard-Ṁac*, see note 9.
The form of "wishing" in lines 23-4 is general in Irish; cf. the following from *Donnċaḋ Caoċ Ó Maṫġaṁna*: *\'S an té do ġairm díom Splinc, ar Ċríost nár ḟeiciḋ sé splannc*\'.
[^15]: *Alla-ṫuirc* = *all-ṫuirc*.

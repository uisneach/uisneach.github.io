#### Passages from the *Lebor Gabala Eirinn*, first recension.

38. Partholon had been in Ireland for seven years when the first of his followers died: Fea, from whom is named Mag Fea. For that is where he was buried, in Mag Fea. In the third year afrer that, Partholon won the first battle fought in Ireland in Slemna Maige Itha, against Cichol Gricenchos of the Fomoiri; and it is men with single arms and single legs who fought against him.

45. It is Nemed who won the battle of Ros Froechain against Gann and Sengann, the kings of the Fomoiri; and both of them were killed there. Two royal forts were dug by Nemed in Ireland: Raith Chimbaith in Seimne, and Raith Chinn Eich among the Ui Niallain. It is the four sons of Matan Muinremar of the Fomoiri who dug Raith Chinn Eich in a single day: Boe and Roboc, Ruibne and Rotan. Nemed killed them in Daire Lige before morning, before they could finish the digging.

47. He won three battles against the Fomoiri, i.e., the sea-rovers [*loigsig na fairgi* in the [manuscript](https://archive.org/details/leborgablare03macauoft/leborgablare03macauoft/page/122/mode/2up?q=fomo)]: the battle of Bodbgna in Connacht, the battle of Cnamros among the Laigin, the battle of Murbolg in Dal Riata. After that Nemed died of pestilence in Ailen Arda Nemid, in the territory of the Ui Liathain.

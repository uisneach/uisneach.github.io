    "description": "From ancient times until the fall of the Gaelic Order, a sacred fire at Uisneaċ was lit on Beltaine each year to initiate the Mórdáil Uisneaċ, the Great Assembly. As such Uisneaċ became spiritually the Umbilicas Hibernicae, the Navel of Ireland. It was a ceremonial gathering place for kings, possibly where the High King would symbolically marry the goddess Ériu in the banais ríghe ritual, or Marriage of the King. A fire was kept there perpetually into the Christian Age, kept alight by woman-druids in a similar fashion to Rome’s sacred flame tended by Vestal Virgins.",

Some (most?) of these poems are captured in a work called Poetae Latinae Aevi Carolini, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/poetaelatiniaevi00dm/page/392/mode/2up\">published</a> by Ernst Dümmler in 1881, which prints them in Latin and which, as far as I can tell, have not yet been translated to English except for a handful published in Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance by Peter Godman in 1981.</p>\n<p>This poet is anonymous, and identified himself only with this pseudonym. Historians have tried, through mere conjecture, to identify him with the other Irish scholars known to have been in the Carolingian court, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungal\">Dungal</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicuil\">Dicuil</a>, who certainly qualify as educated Irishmen far from home. But nothing can be known for sure. These two poems specifically are panegyrics for Charlemagne, and offer a glimpse into the scholastic Christianity of the 8th century AD.</p>\n<p>In this post I follow the poem numberings presented by Dümmler, and only post two for some light reading during Christmas. I will translate more later for completeness.</p>\n<h1 id=\"1\">1.</h1>\n<p>O deus omnipotens, convexae conditor arcis,<br>\nTerrarum et maris et quae tantus continet orbis,<br>\nSuscipe vota tuae plebis, dignare rogatus<br>\nCaesaris eximii Karoli firmare salutem;<br>\nMultiplices vitam protendens, rector, in annos,<br>\nImperio oceanum consignans ordine metam,<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\"><span class=\"hint--top hint--error hint--medium hint--rounded hint--bounce\" aria-label=\"This is a double accusative construction, where *oceanum* and *metam* are the accusatives.
